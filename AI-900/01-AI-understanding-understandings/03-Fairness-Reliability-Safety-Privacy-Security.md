### Guiding Principles in AI: Detailed Examination

#### 1. Fairness
- **Definition**: AI systems should treat everyone fairly and avoid affecting similarly situated groups differently.
- **Examples**:
  - **Healthcare**: Prioritizing emergency room patients based on health needs rather than wealth or other unrelated factors.
  - **Bank Loans**: Decisions should not be based on arbitrary factors like names (e.g., favoring "Michael" over "Alice").

#### 2. Reliability and Safety
- **Definition**: AI systems should operate reliably and safely under normal and unexpected conditions.
- **Importance**: Builds trust in AI systems.
- **Examples**:
  - **Sunny Day Development**: Systems often designed assuming perfect conditions (no anomalies, perfect data).
  - **Real-World Testing**: Systems must handle real-life conditions (bad data, edge cases).
  - **Tesla Autopilot**: Needs testing beyond perfect lane markings, including night driving, rain, snowstorms, and potential manipulations (e.g., stickers on the road).
  - **Military Operations**: Must function without GPS and handle various approach angles.

#### 3. Privacy and Security
- **Definition**: AI systems must protect user privacy and secure data.
- **Importance**: Increasing concern with connected computers and global data protection laws.
- **Examples**:
  - **Data Protection Laws**: Many countries implement laws to protect citizen data, often lagging behind technological advances.
  - **Target Incident**: 
    - **Scenario**: Target sent baby-related coupons to a teenager, revealing her pregnancy to her father before she did.
    - **Explanation**: Purchase tracking indicated prenatal signs (e.g., vitamins).
    - **Solution**: Include non-related items in mailings to obscure targeted marketing.
