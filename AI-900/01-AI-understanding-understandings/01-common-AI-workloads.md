#### Common AI Workloads

1. **Prediction and Demand Forecasting**
   - **Example:**
     - **Data**: Number of visitors vs. amount of sales.
     - **Graph**: Scatter graph shows a linear relationship.
     - **Machine Learning (ML)**: 
       - Supervised learning involves labeling data and predicting outcomes.
       - Applications: Autocorrect, auto-suggest (e.g., Google search predictions), Netflix recommendations, Amazon suggestions.

2. **Anomaly Detection**
   - **Example:**
     - **Graph**: Blue solid line (actual result) vs. shaded blue line (predicted result).
     - **Usage**: Detect irregular patterns (e.g., heartbeat, log files, IoT device sensors).
     - **Sensitivity Settings**: Can be adjusted (e.g., 85%, 90%, 95%).

3. **Computer Vision**
   - **Example:**
     - Image analysis using Microsoft’s computer vision API.
     - Capabilities: Identifying faces, generating descriptions, detecting adult content, estimating age and gender.
     - **Application**: Useful in various image recognition tasks.

4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
   - **Example:**
     - Understanding and responding to human language queries (e.g., "What time are you open until today?").
     - **Applications**: Customer service, chatbots.

5. **Knowledge Mining**
   - **Example:**
     - Sorting through a collection of documents (PDFs, images, Word docs, PowerPoints) to create a searchable index.
     - **Leaders**: Google, Bing.
     - **Application**: Organizing and searching large collections of documents.

6. **Content Moderation**
   - **Example:**
     - Filtering user-generated content for profanity, adult content, hate speech, violence, and spam.
     - **Adjustability**: Severity levels can be set for filtering (e.g., high, medium, low).
     - **Support**: Works across text, video, and images, and supports multiple languages.

7. **Generative AI**
   - **Example:**
     - Creating images or text based on input tags or detailed descriptions (e.g., DALL-E for images, Chat GPT for text).
     - **Applications**: Chatbots, image generation.
     - **Controversy**: Use of training data and intellectual property concerns.
     - **Services**: Available within Microsoft Azure OpenAI services.

### Overview Summary
