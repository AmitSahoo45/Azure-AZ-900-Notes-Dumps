#### Section Overview
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Common machine learning types
  - Core machine learning concepts
  - Azure machine learning without coding

### Common Machine Learning Types

1. **Regression**
   - **Category**: Supervised Learning
   - **Definition**: Predicting an outcome variable (numeric) based on one or more predictor variables.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Outcome is numeric (e.g., price, amount, size).
     - Finds relationships between variables (e.g., sales prediction based on traffic).
   - **Example**: Predicting sales based on the number of visitors.

2. **Classification**
   - **Category**: Supervised Learning
   - **Definition**: Assigning items into categories based on labeled data.
   - **Types**:
     - **Binary Classification**: Determines if an item is in one of two categories (e.g., is it an apple? Yes/No).
     - **Multi-class Classification**: Assigns items to one of several categories (e.g., is it an apple, orange, or banana?).
   - **Example**: Identifying the type of fruit in an image.

3. **Clustering**
   - **Category**: Unsupervised Learning
   - **Definition**: Grouping data points into clusters based on their similarities without labeled data.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - No predefined labels.
     - Generates insights by finding natural groupings in data.
   - **Example**: Identifying traits common to the best customers.

### Machine Learning Examples
- **Movie Recommendation Engine (e.g., Netflix)**
  - **Type**: Likely uses classification algorithms.
- **Car Image Recognition**
  - **Type**: Uses classification algorithms to identify make and model.
- **Predicting Happiness Based on Salary**
  - **Type**: Regression algorithm.
  - **Reason**: Predicts a numerical value (happiness score) based on salary.
- **Email Spam Filter**
  - **Type**: Classification algorithm (spam or not spam).

### Key Concepts
- **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms learn from labeled data.
  - **Regression**: Predicts numerical outcomes.
  - **Classification**: Categorizes data into predefined groups.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Algorithms find patterns and groupings in unlabeled data.
  - **Clustering**: Discovers natural groupings within data.

### Azure Machine Learning
- **No-Code Machine Learning**: Azure provides tools to create machine learning models without needing to write code.
- **Core Features**:
  - Simplifies the process of developing machine learning models.
  - Accessible to users without extensive programming knowledge.
