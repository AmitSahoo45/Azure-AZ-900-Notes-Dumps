Sure! Here are the useful notes derived from the provided transcript on Azure Networking:

### Azure Networking Overview

#### Virtual Networks (VNets)
- **Definition**: Virtual networks (VNets) are virtualized network structures within Azure, allowing connectivity between Azure resources.
- **Purpose**: Enable secure communication between Azure resources (e.g., virtual machines).

#### Azure's Physical Network
- **Global Infrastructure**: Azure's physical network consists of cables, switches, routers, and satellites connecting all Azure data centers.

#### VNet Basics
1. **Address Space**:
   - **Definition**: A range of IP addresses assigned to a VNet.
   - **Types**: IPv4 or IPv6.
   - **Private Addresses**: Addresses are private and not accessible from the public internet.
   - **Generous Allocation**: Allocate large address spaces to support future growth.

2. **Subnets**:
   - **Definition**: Subdivisions within a VNet.
   - **Minimum**: At least one subnet per VNet.
   - **IP Range**: Each subnet has an IP range that is a subset of the VNet's address space.
   - **Security**: Traffic between subnets can be restricted based on security rules.

3. **Network Interface Card (NIC)**:
   - **Function**: Connects a virtual machine (VM) to a subnet.
   - **Multiple NICs**: A VM can have multiple NICs to connect to different subnets, with each NIC assigned a unique private IP address.

4. **Public IP Addresses**:
   - **Optional**: Assign a public IP to a VM for direct internet access.
   - **Best Practices**: Generally, use firewalls or gateways for security instead of directly exposing VMs to the internet.

#### Network Security Groups (NSGs)
- **Definition**: Access control lists that manage inbound and outbound traffic to subnets or individual NICs.
- **Rules**:
  - **Elements**: Source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, and protocol (TCP/UDP).
  - **Wildcards**: Can use wildcards for broader rules (e.g., all IPs, all ports).
  - **Priorities**: Rules are prioritized, and the first matching rule is applied.
  - **Allow/Deny**: Rules can either allow or deny traffic.

#### Key Concepts
- **Security**: By default, VMs cannot connect to each other without explicitly configured VNets.
- **Connectivity**: VNets enable controlled and secure communication between Azure resources.
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: VNets are part of Azure's IaaS offerings, similar to virtual machines.

### Example Scenario
1. **Creating a VNet**:
   - Define an address space (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
   - Allocate private IP ranges.

2. **Creating Subnets**:
   - Subnet 1: 10.0.1.0/24
   - Subnet 2: 10.0.2.0/24

3. **Assigning NICs**:
   - VM1 connected to Subnet 1.
   - VM2 connected to Subnet 2.
   - Each VM gets a private IP from the subnet's range.

4. **Setting Up NSGs**:
   - NSG for Subnet 1: Allow traffic from Subnet 2 (source: 10.0.2.0/24).
   - NSG for Subnet 2: Allow traffic from Subnet 1 (source: 10.0.1.0/24).

### Summary
- **Virtual Networks (VNets)**: Enable secure communication and connectivity between Azure resources.
- **Subnets**: Subdivisions of VNets with specific IP ranges.
- **Network Interface Cards (NICs)**: Connect VMs to subnets.
- **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**: Control traffic with allow/deny rules based on IPs, ports, and protocols.
- **Security and Scalability**: VNets and subnets provide a scalable and secure infrastructure for Azure resources.
