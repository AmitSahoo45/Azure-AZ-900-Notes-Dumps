The solution provided is almost correct, but it slightly misses the mark. Here's why:

### Analysis of the Solution:

1. **Using Azure Cloud Shell:**
   - Launching Azure Cloud Shell from the Azure portal is correct and appropriate for running Azure CLI commands.
   
2. **Selecting the Environment:**
   - The problem is that the solution specifies selecting **PowerShell** in Azure Cloud Shell, but the command provided is an Azure CLI command (`az vm create ...`).

### Correct Approach:

To run Azure CLI commands in Azure Cloud Shell, you need to select the **Bash** environment, not PowerShell. The `az` command is part of the Azure CLI, which is typically used in the Bash environment of Azure Cloud Shell.

### Correct Solution:

1. **From the Azure Portal:**
   - Sign in to the Azure portal.
   - Launch Azure Cloud Shell by clicking on the Cloud Shell icon (a >_ symbol) in the top navigation bar.
   
2. **Select the Environment:**
   - Choose **Bash** as the environment in Cloud Shell.

3. **Run the Command:**
   - Run the following command in the Bash environment of Cloud Shell:
     ```sh
     az vm create --resource-group RG1 --name VM1 --image UbuntuLTS --generate-ssh-keys
     ```

### Summary:

- **Issue with Original Solution:** The original solution incorrectly suggests using the PowerShell environment in Cloud Shell for an Azure CLI command.
- **Correct Environment:** The correct environment to run Azure CLI commands is **Bash** in Azure Cloud Shell.

Therefore, the answer is **No** because the command provided (`az vm create ...`) is intended to be run in the Bash environment, not PowerShell. If you were to select the Bash environment, the command would work as expected.
