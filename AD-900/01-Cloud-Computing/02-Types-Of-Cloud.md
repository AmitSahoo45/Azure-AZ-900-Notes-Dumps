# Types of Cloud Platforms

## Public Cloud
- **Definition**: Computing services offered by third-party providers over the public internet, available to anyone who wants to purchase them.
- **Example**: Microsoft Azure Public Cloud
- **Ownership**: Hardware is owned by the cloud service provider (e.g., Azure)
- **Access**: Available to anyone with a credit card or an enterprise agreement.

## Private Cloud
- **Definition**: Computing services offered either over the internet or a private internal network, available only to select users.
- **Example**: Government cloud
- **Ownership**: Hardware can be owned, leased, or exclusively accessed by the customer.
- **Access**: Requires an invitation; exclusive to certain users or organizations.
- **Microsoft Azure Private Cloud**: Azure Stack HCI, which can be rented or bought for use on own hardware.

## Hybrid Cloud
- **Definition**: A computing environment that combines a private cloud with a public cloud.
- **Example**: SQL Stretch Database (deprecated), where a local database can seamlessly access the cloud for additional storage.
- **Functionality**: Allows running services on a private cloud and scaling out to the public cloud for additional resources.
- **Benefits**: Combines privacy and exclusive access of a private cloud with the scalability of a public cloud.
